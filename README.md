# Doubly-Linked-List-Project

This is a project from Spring 2019 for my CS101 course.  It implements a Doubly Linked List that holds hypothetical racing stats.  It also introduces an interesting concept of domination where the entry relating to one stat can "dominate" and remove another from the linked list due to stat criteria explained in the dList.cpp documentation.

Functions/Usage: 
1. Constructor (double linked list object constructor)
2. MergeSort/Merge (sorts doubly linked list using MergeSort algorithm)
3. Insert (inserts a stat Node into doubly linked list)
4. DeleteNode (deletes a stat Node from doubly linked list)
5. Out (outputs entries of doubly linked list, has an optional overloaded function to limit however many entries outputted)

Note: Although they were not required for the project, good practice would include a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator.

Credit: 
1. The concept for the project and Makefile were written and supplied by my professor, Dr. Brandon Dixon, and the University of Alabama's Computer Science Department.
2. The dList.cpp file was written by myself.
